# Explaining this Demo

This is a simple React demo for our assignment group.

- Uses TypeScript as the main language
- Uses SCSS for styling
- Uses React-Router to create a multi-page app.

## Setup

To setup, clone the repo on your local machine.
Go to the project folder and run 
`npm install`
to install the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run 
`npm start` to start the dev server.
When you make changes to the files and save, they will automatically update on the server, 
and you should be able to immediately see it in the browser.

## Folders

### `public`

This folder contains the `index.html` and related resources. The app will be mounted in `index.html`, 
opening the file by itself will not work. 

### `src`

Contains the source code for the project. There are explanations for each file inside the file. 

`setupTests.ts`, `react-app-env.d.ts` and `reportWebVitals.ts` are files that are created automatically
with the project. `react-app-env.d.ts` is necessary for the project to work with TypeScript (I believe), 
but the others are not strictly necessary (`setupTests.ts` is for tests, and I'm not 100% sure what 
`reportWebVitals.ts` is for, but I think it's something to do with benchmarking (??))
